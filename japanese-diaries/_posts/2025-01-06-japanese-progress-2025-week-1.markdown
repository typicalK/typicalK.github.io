Reflecting on my progress and sharing what I’ve learned over the past week. Despite the holiday period, I managed to have a productive tutoring session, focusing on vocabulary from the Genki Textbook.

## What I Learned

We focused on expanding my vocabulary, covering a mix of nouns, adjectives, and verbs. Here are some highlights:

### Nouns

- Family-related terms like かぞく (kazoku) – Family and おじいさん (ojiisan) – Grandfather.
- Everyday words like くるま (kuruma) – Car and しょくどう (shokudō) – Cafeteria.

### Adjectives

- い-adjectives:
  - ながい (nagai) – Long
  - かわいい (kawaii) – Cute
- な-adjectives:
  - しんせつ (shinsetsu) – Kind
  - べんり (benri) – Convenient

### Verbs

- U-verbs like しる (shiru) – To get to know.
- Ru-verbs like きる (kiru) – To put on (clothes above your waist).
- The irregular verb けっこんする (kekkon suru) – To get married.

### Expressions and Adverbs

- ひとり (hitori) – One person
- もちろん (mochiron) – Of course
- よかったら (yokattara) – If you like

## My Reflection

This session helped me solidify vocabulary related to family and daily life, which I know will be useful for future conversations. It also introduced me to some key verbs and adjectives, which I’ll try to incorporate into future sentences.

## Tips for the Week

1. **Break It Down**: Focus on small groups of words each day to make memorisation easier.
2. **Practice in Context**: Create simple sentences using the new vocabulary to reinforce understanding.
3. **Review Regularly**: Spend a few minutes each day revisiting what I learned to ensure it sticks.
